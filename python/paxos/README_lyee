Overall design:
  We used Python 2.7.3 as our language of choice.
  We a process for each of the clients and servers. For IPC, we used Pipes in
  the multiprocessing package.
  Each server has all three roles of proposer, learner and acceptor.
  We used the view-change model, and the clients elect a leader by sending
  messages to it. A server know that it is the leader if it is receiving
  messages from clients.

Details on how we implemented the commands:

start [servers] [clients]
  The Master process spawns a process for each server and client and creates 
  Pipes for each of them.
